# Terminology

## Deployment Types

Before getting too deep into the bits let's make sure we're using the same
terminology for things. There are 2 main ways to deploy RockNSM:

1. Single Node
2. Multi Node


### Single Node

A "Single Node Deployment" is used to deploy one _standalone_ ROCK sensor. This
is the simplest scenario and the most common use case.  


### Multi-Node

A "Muti-Node Deployment" is used to interconnect a collection of ROCK sensors that
have already been installed and can talk to each other on the same network.

This requires a bit more work up front to deploy, but is allows for a lot of
scaling and flexibility to share workload across multiple boxes.
