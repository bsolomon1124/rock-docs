## Community Support
For community support using ROCK, we encourage you to check out the fine members over at the [RockNSM Community Site](https://community.rocknsm.io/). From there you'll be able to connect with other users of ROCK as well as the developers and maintainers of the project. This is by far the fastest way to connect with others as well as start to troubleshoot issues you may be experiencing.
